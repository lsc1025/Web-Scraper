Kerry Harty / say



Two weeks ago we arrived at OPH with my 86 year old father. Due to the poor care he was receiving living in Calgary, he was emaciated, sick, and his mental health was deteriorating rapidly. He could barely walk into the facility and we thought there was no way he would be able to figure out the elevator fob or when it was time to go for meals. His conversation was barely intelligible and he lacked any kind of self confidence.



In just two weeks he has improved so much it is hard to believe it is the same man! He goes down for his meals regularly to join the other seniors and has made new friends. Everyday we ask him what he had to eat and he will always proclaim “it was the best _______ he has ever had in his life”! He loves the food and has gained a lot of weight. He now walk



s regularly down to the Promenade and he is walking upright with confidence. On Thursday he went to “Happy Hour” and had a wonderful time.
